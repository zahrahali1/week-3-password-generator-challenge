# <Passowrd Generator Challenge 3>

## Description

I have created this password generator which allows employees with access to sensitive data to generate strong passwords that meet certain criteria, enhancing security.

It has features that include user-defined password length (8 to 128 characters). User can select which character types to include: lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.

First it will ask how long do you want your password to be? (Between 8 and 128 characters)
